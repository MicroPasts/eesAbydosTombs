At a distance of 8.0 from the top of the shaft was the body of a man almost perfectly preserved but with the face broken in. (6 ft. tall.) In the chamber which was full of sand were found a very perfect skull and a red pottery vase. The top of the pit had had a brick lining originally which was not built on the gebel level but on a lower stratum some 3 ft. above. The wall itself was about 3'.6"" high thus making total depth of pit 16'.6"".
